## Hello, I'm Aadarsha

I am a Master of Science in Computer Science student at [Washington University in St. Louis (WashU)](https://www.washu.edu/), with a focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly in neuroscience applications. My research interests combine cutting-edge AI techniques with practical applications in healthcare and cognitive science.

### Current Work

As a Graduate Assistant at the Taylor Family Center for Student Success at WashU, I lead initiatives for first-generation and low-income student success through data-driven program planning and assessment. I coordinate events, lead marketing initiatives, track student metrics, and support alumni engagement through newsletter development and database management.

### Previous Work

Previously, as a Data Analyst Intern at [Lab714](https://www.lab714.com/), I engineered software solutions for proprietary IoT devices, extracting actionable insights that reduced client costs by 20%. I leveraged React.js and AWS to develop user-friendly dashboards for data visualization and interaction.

### Research & Projects

I have developed several innovative projects at the intersection of AI and practical applications:

- **[Datacenter Cooling Optimization](/projects/2024-12-datacenter-cooling)** using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDQN, PPO, SAC), achieving 35.8% improved energy efficiency over baseline controllers. This research specifically addressed the understudied small to mid-sized datacenter market, which comprises over 60% of the total market share.

- **[Multimodal Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease](/projects/2024-12-multimodal-alzheimers)** utilizing the OASIS-1 dataset, where I combined deep learning models (CNNs) for MRI image analysis with machine learning techniques for clinical data processing, creating a comprehensive early detection system documented in NeurIPS format.

- **[Interactive Storybook Application](/projects/2024-12-interactive-storybook)** built with Vue.js, Node.js, and MongoDB that features AI-powered content generation through OpenAI API integration, enabling dynamic story text and contextual image generation based on user choices.

- **Artificial Intelligence in Gaming**, where I implemented alpha-beta pruning algorithms for [Connect 4](/projects/2022-11-connect-4-ai) (achieving 100% wins against baseline AI) and created a custom evaluation function for the [Lost Cities](/projects/2022-07-artificial-intelligence-in-modern-board-games) card game (winning 73% of games against baseline).

### Technical Expertise

I have extensive experience with:
- **Programming Languages**: Java, C++, Python, R, JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, SQL, Rust
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Node.js, Vue.js, React, Socket\.IO
- **Tools & Technologies**: Git, Tableau, Power BI, AWS, MongoDB, MySQL
- **Core Competencies**: Machine Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Data Analysis, Web Development, Problem Solving

For a complete overview of my skills and experience, please check my [CV/Resume](/cv/).

### Academic Background

I graduated from [Ohio Wesleyan University](https://www.owu.edu/) with a BA in [Computer Science](https://www.owu.edu/academics/departments-programs/department-of-mathematics-and-computer-science/computer-science-general-major/) and [Data Analytics](https://www.owu.edu/academics/departments-programs/data-analytics-program/data-analytics-major/), complemented by a minor in [Economics](https://www.owu.edu/academics/departments-programs/economics-and-business-department/minors/#:~:text=More%20Information-,Economics%20Minor,-Economics%20is%20a). My academic journey has been distinguished by multiple honors, including:

- Mortar Board National College Senior Honor Society Membership
- Golden Bishop Award for outstanding contributions to student government
- Florence Leas Sophomore Prize
- Dean's List recognition (Spring 2022 & Spring 2023)
- First Place at the 32nd Annual Spring Programming Contest, Denison University (Spring 2022)

My undergraduate research culminated in presentations at the OWU Spring Student Symposium and the 30th Annual Patricia Belt Conrades Summer Science Research Symposium, where I shared insights on [AI's impact in workplaces](/projects/2023-04-artificial-intelligence-opinion-survey) and [board game applications](/projects/2022-07-artificial-intelligence-in-modern-board-games).

### Leadership & Involvement

At Washington University, I serve as:
- McKelvey Graduate Ambassador, representing the McKelvey School of Engineering and engaging with prospective students through outreach and mentorship
- Member of the Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC), contributing to constitutional review and policy development
  - Representative to the Graduate Professional Council Chamber (GPC) for McKelvey Engineering
- Member of the Association of Graduate Engineering Students (AGES), organizing networking events and professional development opportunities
- Treasurer for HackWashU, managing finances, sponsorship outreach, and event planning

These roles reflect my commitment to community building and professional development beyond technical work.

### Passions & Goals

I am passionate about leveraging data science and AI to solve meaningful problems in healthcare and society. My research in [Alzheimer's detection](/projects/2024-12-multimodal-alzheimers) and [datacenter optimization](/projects/2024-12-datacenter-cooling) demonstrates my commitment to applying AI for social good. As a strong communicator and mentor, I value collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the tech community.

I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on innovative [projects](/projects/) or discuss emerging trends in AI and data science. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:a.gopalareddy@wustl.edu) if you're interested in connecting!
