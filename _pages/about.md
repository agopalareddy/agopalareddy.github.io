## Hello, I'm Aadarsha

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://www.washu.edu/), passionate about applying AI and machine learning to healthcare challenges. My thesis research focuses on using domain-adversarial learning to detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease through driving behavior analysis.

Beyond research, I work as a Graduate Assistant with WashU's [Taylor Family Center for Student Success](https://students.wustl.edu/taylor-family-center-student-success/), where I combine my technical skills with my commitment to student support—managing the center's website, leading data initiatives, and developing training resources.

### What I'm Working On

**Research:** Building a Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) to create vehicle-agnostic cognitive signatures from naturalistic driving data for early Alzheimer's detection.

**Student Affairs:** Administering web systems, designing data workflows, and creating documentation to support first-generation and limited-income student programs.

**Leadership:** Serving as Vice President of the Graduate-Professional Council Chamber and on three university advisory boards (Student Affairs, Career Engagement, and Bauer Leaders Academy).

### Featured Projects

- **[Multimodal Alzheimer's Prediction](/projects/2024-12-multimodal-alzheimers)** — Combined CNNs for MRI analysis with clinical data models for early detection, documented in NeurIPS format.

- **[Datacenter Cooling Optimization](/projects/2024-12-datacenter-cooling)** — Applied deep reinforcement learning (DDQN, PPO, SAC) to achieve 35.8% energy efficiency improvement.

- **[Interactive Storybook](/projects/2024-12-interactive-storybook)** — Full-stack application with Vue.js, Node.js, and MongoDB featuring AI-powered story generation via OpenAI API.

### Background

I'm currently completing my M.S. in Computer Science at WashU (expected May 2026), with coursework in AI for Health, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Computational Biology. I hold a B.A. in Computer Science & Data Analytics from [Ohio Wesleyan University](https://www.owu.edu/), where I was recognized with the Golden Bishop Award and Mortar Board membership.

Previously, I interned as an AI Engineer at Crittero, Inc. and as a Data Analyst at Lab714, where I built full-stack applications and delivered data-driven insights.

### Let's Connect

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects at the intersection of AI and social impact. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:a.gopalareddy@wustl.edu) or explore my [CV](/cv/) for more details.
