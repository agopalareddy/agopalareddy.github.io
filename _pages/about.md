## Hello, I'm Aadarsha

I am a Master of Science in Computer Science student at [Washington University in St. Louis (WashU)](https://www.washu.edu/), focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning for health and neuroscience applications. My current thesis explores domain-adversarial learning to build a vehicle-agnostic driving signature for early detection of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.

### Current Work

- Master's Thesis (DRIVES Project, WashU): Implementing a Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) to improve cross-domain generalization of driving-behavior models for Alzheimer's diagnosis.
- Leadership: Vice President of the Graduate-Professional Council (GPC) Chamber, Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC); Constitution Committee Chair.
- Community: Treasurer, Umang (Indian Graduate Student Association); Member, Association of Graduate Engineering Students (AGES).

### Previous Work

- AI Engineer Intern, Crittero, Inc. (Summer 2025): Built a social media simulation and recommendation system. Developed a persona-based synthetic data pipeline in TypeScript and a foundational recommendation model in TensorFlow/Keras; created a Python testing CLI for reproducibility.
- Graduate Assistant, Taylor Family Center for Student Success, WashU (Fall 2024 – Spring 2025): Led FLI student initiatives, managed marketing/newsletters, and developed data-driven assessment workflows.
- Data Analyst Intern, [Lab714](https://www.lab714.com/) (Summer 2023 – Summer 2024): Engineered React + AWS solutions for IoT data, delivering insights that reduced client costs by 20%.

### Research & Projects

I have developed several innovative projects at the intersection of AI and practical applications:

- **[Datacenter Cooling Optimization](/projects/2024-12-datacenter-cooling)** using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDQN, PPO, SAC), achieving 35.8% improved energy efficiency over baseline controllers. This research specifically addressed the understudied small to mid-sized datacenter market, which comprises over 60% of the total market share.

- **[Multimodal Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease](/projects/2024-12-multimodal-alzheimers)** utilizing the OASIS-1 dataset, where I combined deep learning models (CNNs) for MRI image analysis with machine learning techniques for clinical data processing, creating a comprehensive early detection system documented in NeurIPS format.

- **[Interactive Storybook Application](/projects/2024-12-interactive-storybook)** built with Vue.js, Node.js, and MongoDB that features AI-powered content generation through OpenAI API integration, enabling dynamic story text and contextual image generation based on user choices.

- **[Socket.IO Multi-Room Chat Application](/projects/2024-11-socketio-chat-app)** featuring password-protected rooms, private messaging, and moderation with real-time event-based communication.

- **[PHP Calendar Application](/projects/2024-11-php-calendar-app)** with secure authentication, CSRF protection, and an interactive event management interface.

- **Artificial Intelligence in Gaming**, where I implemented alpha-beta pruning algorithms for [Connect 4](/projects/2022-11-connect-4-ai) (achieving 100% wins against baseline AI) and created a custom evaluation function for the [Lost Cities](/projects/2022-07-artificial-intelligence-in-modern-board-games) card game (winning 73% of games against baseline).

### Technical Expertise

 I have extensive experience with:

- **Programming Languages**: Java, C++, Python, R, JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, C#, SQL, Rust
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Node.js, Vue.js, React, Socket.IO, OpenAI/Gemini APIs
- **Tools & Technologies**: Git, Tableau, Power BI, AWS, MongoDB, MySQL, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace
- **Core Competencies**: Machine Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Data Analysis, Web Development, Problem Solving, Communication, Leadership

For a complete overview of my skills and experience, please check my [CV/Resume](/cv/).

### Academic Background

I graduated from [Ohio Wesleyan University](https://www.owu.edu/) with a BA in [Computer Science](https://www.owu.edu/academics/departments-programs/department-of-mathematics-and-computer-science/computer-science-general-major/) and [Data Analytics](https://www.owu.edu/academics/departments-programs/data-analytics-program/data-analytics-major/), complemented by a minor in [Economics](https://www.owu.edu/academics/departments-programs/economics-and-business-department/minors/#:~:text=More%20Information-,Economics%20Minor,-Economics%20is%20a). My academic journey has been distinguished by multiple honors, including:

- Mortar Board National College Senior Honor Society Membership
- Golden Bishop Award for outstanding contributions to student government
- Florence Leas Sophomore Prize
- Dean's List recognition (Spring 2022 & Spring 2023)
- First Place at the 32nd Annual Spring Programming Contest, Denison University (Spring 2022)

My undergraduate research culminated in presentations at the OWU Spring Student Symposium and the 30th Annual Patricia Belt Conrades Summer Science Research Symposium, where I shared insights on [AI's impact in workplaces](/projects/2023-04-artificial-intelligence-opinion-survey) and [board game applications](/projects/2022-07-artificial-intelligence-in-modern-board-games).

### Leadership & Involvement

 At Washington University, I serve as:

- Vice President of the Graduate-Professional Council (GPC) Chamber, GPSC (Summer 2025 – Present) and Constitution Committee Chair
- Treasurer, Umang (Indian Graduate Student Association) (Summer 2025 – Present)
- Member, Association of Graduate Engineering Students (AGES) (Fall 2024 – Present)
- Former McKelvey School of Engineering representative to the GPC Chamber and member of the Membership/Constitution/Outreach Committee (Fall 2024 – Spring 2025)
- Former Treasurer, HackWashU (Fall 2024 – Summer 2025)

These roles reflect my commitment to community building and professional development beyond technical work.

### Passions & Goals

I am passionate about leveraging data science and AI to solve meaningful problems in healthcare and society. My research in [Alzheimer's detection](/projects/2024-12-multimodal-alzheimers) and [datacenter optimization](/projects/2024-12-datacenter-cooling) demonstrates my commitment to applying AI for social good. As a strong communicator and mentor, I value collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the tech community.

 I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on innovative [projects](/projects/) or discuss emerging trends in AI and data science. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:a.gopalareddy@wustl.edu) if you're interested in connecting!
