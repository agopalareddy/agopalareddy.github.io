## Hello, I'm Aadarsha

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://www.washu.edu/) with hands-on experience in machine learning, data engineering, and full-stack development. My thesis research focuses on using domain-adversarial learning to detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease through driving behavior analysis.

I currently serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for CSE 5114 (Data Manipulation and Management at Scale), guiding students through data pipelines, distributed systems, and real-world capstone projects. I also work as a Graduate Assistant with WashU's [Taylor Family Center for Student Success](https://students.wustl.edu/taylor-family-center-student-success/), leading data initiatives and supporting first-generation and limited-income student programs.

### What I'm Working On

**Research:** Building a Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) to create vehicle-agnostic cognitive signatures from naturalistic driving data for early Alzheimer's detection.

**Teaching:** Guiding students in implementing data pipelines and real-time processing systems, conducting technical oral exams, and mentoring capstone project groups in CSE 5114.

**Student Success:** Driving data assessment and communication strategies at the Taylor Family Center for Student Success, supporting first-generation and limited-income student programs.

**Leadership:** Serving as Vice President of the Graduate-Professional Council Chamber and on three university advisory boards (Student Affairs, Career Engagement, and Bauer Leaders Academy).

### Featured Projects

- **[Multimodal Alzheimer's Prediction](/projects/2024-12-multimodal-alzheimers)** — Combined CNNs for MRI analysis with clinical data models for early detection, documented in NeurIPS format.

- **[Datacenter Cooling Optimization](/projects/2024-12-datacenter-cooling)** — Applied deep reinforcement learning (DDQN, PPO, SAC) to achieve 35.8% energy efficiency improvement.

- **[Interactive Storybook](/projects/2024-12-interactive-storybook)** — Full-stack application with Vue.js, Node.js, and MongoDB featuring AI-powered story generation via OpenAI API.

### Background

I'm currently completing my M.S. in Computer Science at WashU (expected May 2026), with coursework in AI for Health, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Computational Biology. I hold a B.A. in Computer Science & Data Analytics from [Ohio Wesleyan University](https://www.owu.edu/), where I was recognized with the Golden Bishop Award and Mortar Board membership.

Previously, I interned as an AI Engineer at Crittero, Inc. and as a Data Analyst at Lab714, where I built full-stack applications and delivered data-driven insights.

### Let's Connect

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects at the intersection of technology and impact. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:a.gopalareddy@wustl.edu) or explore my [CV](/cv/) for more details.
