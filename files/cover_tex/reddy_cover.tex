    Dear Hiring Manager,
\end{onecolentry}

\vspace{\headerSpacing}
\begin{onecolentry}
    I am writing to express my interest in the Prompt Engineer Internship - Summer 2025 at Paradowski Creative, as advertised on LinkedIn. Your description of seeking a ``curious, clever, and AI-obsessed intern'' who thrives with ``creativity, technology, and experimentation'' immediately resonated with my passion and profile. As a Master’s student in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis with an interest in artificial intelligence and its creative applications, I am eager to ``dive deep into the world of generative AI'' with your team to ``unlock new creative workflows, inspire innovative ideas, and build better brand experiences''.

    My academic background, including extensive coursework in Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning, has provided me with a strong theoretical foundation. However, my true excitement lies in applying these concepts through hands-on experimentation and building. My projects demonstrate this drive, particularly my work on an Interactive Storybook application that leverages the OpenAI API for AI-powered content generation and branching narratives. This project directly reflects my interest in exploring how AI tools can facilitate storytelling and creative prototyping, aligning perfectly with the tasks outlined in the internship, including experimenting with AI tools and assisting creative teams.

    Furthermore, my experience developing AI agents for games like Connect 4 and Lost Cities, and implementing complex algorithms such as Deep Reinforcement Learning for Datacenter Cooling Optimization, showcases my comfort with technical challenges and my desire to push the boundaries of what’s possible with AI. I am comfortable working with language models and various platforms, and my background includes skills in Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and direct experience integrating the OpenAI and Gemini APIs. My strong written communication skills, honed through documentation and academic work, are essential for crafting the clear, effective prompts this role requires.
\end{onecolentry}

\begin{onecolentry}
    Beyond technical skills, my experience as a Data Analyst Intern and in various leadership roles has equipped me with valuable core competencies such as problem-solving, analytical thinking, communication, and team collaboration. I am adept at documenting processes and insights, contributing to team goals, and adapting quickly to new tools and environments - skills vital for assisting creative and strategic teams and helping evolve internal playbooks and best practices.

\begin{onecolentry}
    I am currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis, confirming my ability to work in-person in St. Louis for the duration of the 9-week internship from June 2 to August 1, 2025. I am excited about the prospect of working closely with a mentor and interacting with the rest of the 2025 intern cohort.

    I am a naturally curious and self-starting thinker who genuinely loves to tinker and explore. This internship feels like the perfect opportunity to channel that energy into meaningful contributions within a creative agency setting. I am confident I can bring a unique blend of technical AI knowledge and creative problem-solving to Paradowski Creative, and I am particularly drawn to the prospect of having a lot of fun while doing so!
